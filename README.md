1. Download the folders and files into a new project folder
2. Open the project folder into an IDE (VS Code recommended)
3. Run the program in the IDE (press F5 if using VS Code)
4. Executing the program opens a web page in Edge with the application
5. In the application, go to the A* Visualizer tab
6. Click on the grid cells to add/remove walls

**NOTE**
  - Have the C# extension and C# Dev Kit extension installed in VS Code
  - Have the .Net Install Tool extension and the .Net Extension Pack installed in VS Code
  - Have the .Net version 10 installed (dotnet --version command on powershell should output something like 10.0.101)
    
**I am currently working on publishing the web page online, so it has a working URL and thus no need to download the application to use it**
